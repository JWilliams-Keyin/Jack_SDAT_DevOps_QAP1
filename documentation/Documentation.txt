1. Clean code practices were used all throughout the project.
In particular, I made sure to have descriptive names, keep comments
to a minimum (only using useful ones), and I made sure to keep my
methods as short as possible. See screenshots of each example in the
documentation folder.

2. My project is a simple video game store. Here is a breakdown of how it works:

VideoGame.java: A simple video game object that stores all of the data
                related to each game in stock.

Cart.Java: Handles adding and removing games from the user's cart, as
           well as calculating the total price of all the games.

Purchase.java: A simple object that stores the data of related to the
               user's purchase. It holds all of the games they bought,
               as well as the total price of those games.

VideoGameCatalog.java: Holds the data of all available games that the
                       store has to offer.

PurchaseService.java: Handles the logic side of purchasing. It takes
                      the data from the user's cart and gives back
                      a purchase object with that data, while also
                      clearing the cart.

GameStore.java: The main file that shows all of the functionality of
                the program.

3. The dependency needed was JUnit 5. I got this dependency from one
   of Jordan's repos, as the websites I found while googling didn't
   have the latest version.

4. The only problem I encountered during this QAP was my unexpectedly
   busy schedule, so I just barely managed to pass this in on time.
   I would have liked to add more features like a scanner based menu,
   and mocking using Mockito in the tests.
